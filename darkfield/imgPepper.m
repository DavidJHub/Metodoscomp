function pxIM = imgPepper( IM,TH )
%function pxIM = imgPepper( IM,TH )
%
%Function that removes dead pixels from an image, and replaces them
%with the average of its 8-neighbours. This removes pepper noise.
%
%pxIM: Corrected image.
%IM: Raw image.
%TH: Cutting threshold to decide the percentage of the max image value that 
%is considered low enough to deem the pixel dead. Values between 0 and 1.
